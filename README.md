# POWER-BI-Customer-churn-report
As the second task of my virtual job simulation with PWC Switzerland, for the same telecom client PhoneNow, we have to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, aimed at analyzing customer retention and identifying risk factors. The dashboard provides critical insights into customer demographics, service subscriptions, account information, and churn metrics to support customer retention through data-driven decision-making.

## Key Insights:
- **Customer Demographics:** Gender distribution is nearly equal (49.5% male, 50.5% female). Significant segments include 25% senior citizens, 36% with partners, and 17% dependents. Notably, 29.4% have less than a year of service.

- **Customer Account Information:** Electronic checks are the main payment method (34%), with 59.2% using paperless billing. Most customers (55%) have month-to-month contracts.

- **Service Subscriptions:** Phone services are highly subscribed (91%), while streaming TV and movies each have 44% engagement. Device protection (29%) and online security (16%) have lower subscriptions.

- **Customer Churn Analysis:** There are 7043 customers at risk with a churn rate of 26.54%. The highest churn is among fiber optic internet users (41.89%). Month-to-month contracts show a higher churn rate (38.8%).

- **Risk Factors and Churn Metrics:** Key churn factors include internet type, subscription length, and payment methods. Higher monthly charges are linked to increased churn.

**Conclusion:** The Power BI dashboard gives PhoneNow clear KPIs, helping identify at-risk customers and churn factors. Addressing these insights can improve customer retention and call center efficiency.
